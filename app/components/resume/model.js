    I'm an experienced Full Stack web developer who likes working on challenging problems with smart people. I use my skills as a Full Stack developer to gain insight on the bigger picture when breaking down problems and finding solutions that meet given constraints. I like working with groups to solve problems, but I'm perfectly capable of working individually.<br/>
    <br/>
    Given the opportunity I would love to work with an organization that practices test driven development and/or code reviews.

    I'm currently learning <a href="elixir-lang.org">Elixir/Phoenix</a> and working with <a href="vuejs.org">Vue.js</a>.
    <br/>
    
    <h3>My impressions of Vue.js so far.</h3>
    <p>
    It's very easy to pick up if you have a background in <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> or <a href="angularjs.org">Angular</a>. Essentially taking all the best aspects of angular and react but with a minimium api footprint. Also, <a href="brunch.io">Brunch</a> makes it very easy to work with.
    </p>
    
    <h3>My impressions of Elixir.</h3>
    <p>
    I haven't finished learning Elixir basics just yet, but so far it's very enjoyable. Brings back memories of my college Programming Paradigm class. Very functional in a pretty wrapper is the best way to discribe it. Say what you will about functional programming, but it's gives you great tools for concurrent programming.
